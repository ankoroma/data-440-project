# Lifespan of News Stories: A NLP Approach to Extracting Trending News

## Project Idea
Nowadays, millions of news articles and blogs are published online every day. News data is created at the rate one cannot imagine a few years ago. Social media platforms have become the main source of news online to meet the information consumption needs of internet users. However, a large amount of news with repeated, duplicated or junk contents is also created. Therefore, there is an increasing need for automatic grouping of the news based on the contents of articles. This project will explore various NLP techniques for clustering online news and extracting the trending stories over time.
